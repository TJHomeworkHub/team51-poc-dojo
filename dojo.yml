      #### BACKGROUND
      
      Welcome to SecureHealth's Security Engineering Training Program!
      
      
      SecureHealth is a fast-growing healthcare technology startup that provides
      a patient appointment scheduling platform used by over 200 medical practices
      across the country. After a recent security audit, the engineering team
      discovered that the appointment API lacks proper input validation, making
      it vulnerable to injection attacks and malformed data that could compromise
      patient privacy and system stability.
      
      
      #### YOUR ROLE
      
      You've just joined SecureHealth as a junior security engineer, and your
      first assignment is as follows. The appointment-scheduling API is heading
      toward production, but a recent audit revealed that several input fields
      are still vulnerable to malformed data and injection attacks. To ensure the
      system is secure and reliable, the security team has broken the remediation
      work into a sequence of focused tasks, each targeting a specific input field
      that must be validated before release.
      
      
      #### THE VULNERABILITY
      
      The current API accepts user inputs without validation, creating multiple
      security risks:
        - SQL Injection: Attackers could manipulate database queries to access
        or modify unauthorized data
        - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Malicious scripts could be injected and
        executed in users' browsers
        - Data Integrity Issues: Malformed inputs could crash the system or
        corrupt appointment records
        - HIPAA Compliance Violations: Inadequate input controls could expose
        protected health information
      
      
      #### YOUR MISSION
      
      Implement defensive input validation to protect each API endpoint.
      Your validation must:
        1. REJECT malicious inputs that could be used for attacks
        2. ACCEPT all legitimate appointment data
        3. MAINTAIN existing functionality so don't break what works!
        4. PROVIDE clear error messages when validation fails
      
      
      Each challenge in this series focuses on validating a specific input field.
      As you progress, you'll build a complete validation layer that secures the
      entire API.
